# Automated Diagnostics

## What is the Automated Diagnostics Solution and what does it do for you?
Automated Diagnostics can be of huge value when managing incidents. By pulling “diagnostic” data into your incidents, you can both shorten the length of incidents as well as reduce the number of individuals paged to help with resolution.

To help you get a head-start on implementing Automated Diagnostics in your environment, this Solution is a collection of prebuilt Automation Jobs that retrieve data from common infrastructure and services for investigating, debugging and diagnosing incidents.

As an example, if an incident is triggered for a Service running in Kubernetes, Runbook Automation can - at the click of a button or through event-driven invocation - retrieve information from logs, API’s, databases and other sources that support this Service. This information is then presented in the PagerDuty Incident Response interface:
