## Overview

This is a minor release that addresses some bugs and CVEs. 

Highlights:

* We fixed an issue in 4.10.0 which prevented jobs from correctly dispatching to a configured project Runner. 
*  Additionally we updated some dependency packages in the Runner software to address findings by some security scans.  The following CVEs are fixed with the Runner version in this release: [CVE-2022-42004](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42004), [CVE-2022-42003](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42003), and [CVE-2022-41881](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41881). In certain enviornments [CVE-2022-45198](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45198) and [CVE-2022-45199](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45199) may be found.  These are false positives and the package is not used in the Enterprise Runner software.
* This release also fixes an issue where [Results Data](/manual/execution-lifecycle/job-retry-failed-nodes.md) and [ROI Metric](/manual/execution-lifecycle/roi-metrics.md) data were not showing properly in the Output logs.
