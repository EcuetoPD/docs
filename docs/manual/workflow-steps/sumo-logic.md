:::

Sumo Logic provides cloud monitoring, log management, Cloud SIEM tools, and real-time insights for web and SaaS based apps.
The **Sumo Logic workflow steps** allows users to automate operational tasks - such as retrieving logs for incident diagnostics - by integrating with their Sumo instance.

There are two Workflow Step plugins for Sumo Logic:
* [Create and Execute Query Search Job](#execute-a-new-query-in-sumo-logic) - Executes a new logs query in Sumo Logic to surface log data in PagerDuty Process Automation.
* [Execute a Saved Search Query](#execute-a-saved-query-in-sumo-logic) - Executed an existing, saved logs query in Sumo Logic to surface log data in PagerDuty Process Automation.

## Integration Setup

To configure the Sumo Logic workflow steps, API credentials must be generated in Sumo Logic:

1. In the Sumo Logic web app, click your name in the left-nav and open the **Preferences** page.
2. In the **My Access Keys** section, click **+ Add Access Key**.
3. The **Create a Sumo Logic Access Key** window appears.
4. Enter a **Name** for the access key in the Name field. If you donâ€™t want to create an allowlist of domains from which the access key can be used to access Sumo APIs, go to step 8 below.
5. (Optional) In this step, you can define one or more domains that may use the access key to access Sumo APIs. Enter a domain in the **Allowlisted CORS Domains** field and click Add.
6. The window updates, and displays the domain you added.Repeat steps 5 and 6 to add additional domains to the allowlist. 
7. Click **Create Key** to generate the key. 
8. The window displays the generated Access ID and Access Key. Copy both before clicking **Close**. After you press Close, you will not be able to recover the Access ID and Access Key.
