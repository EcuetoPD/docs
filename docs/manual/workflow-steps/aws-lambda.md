# AWS Lambda Workflow Steps

:::enterprise
:::

AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers.

The following Lambda plugins are available for PagerDuty Runbook Automation and Process Automation:

* [Execute Lambda Function](#execute-lambda-function) - Executes an existing Lambda function.
* [Lambda Custom Code Execution](#lambda-custom-code-execution) - Creates and executes a new Lambda function with the custom-code provided in the Job step.

### Authentication
Follow the instructions outlined in the [AWS Plugins Overview](/docs/manual/plugins/aws-plugins-overview.html) for Process Automation to authenticate with AWS.

When defining the IAM Role for Runbook Automation or Process Automation, be sure to include the following permissions in the Policy associated with the role:

* **`lambda:InvokeFunction`** - Necessary for both Lambda workflow step plugins.
* **`lambda:CreateFunction`** - Only if using the _**Lambda Custom Code**_ plugin
* **`lambda:DeleteFunction`** - Only if **`Delete Function After Execution`** is used with the _**Lambda Custom Code**_ plugin.


## Execute Lambda Function

The **AWS / Lambda / Invoke** plugin invokes an _existing_ Lambda function in an AWS account in a specific region:

#### Plugin Field Descriptions

* **Event Payload**: the JSON Event Data that is sent as input to the Lambda function. For more details on Lambda Event Data, click [**here**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-trigger).

* **Invocation Type**: In the _Advanced_ section, this allows you to specify whether this invocation is **synchronous** or **asynchronous**. For synchronous, select **Request** and for asynchronous, select **Event**.
For more details on the differences between Event and Request, click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_Invoke.html).

* **Qualifier**: In the _Advanced_ section, this determines the version of the Lambda function to invoke. For more information on Lambda function versions, click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-versions.html).

* **Client Context**: Context to provide to the Lambda handler. For more details on Lambda Context, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-context.html).

#### Permissions
The following IAM Policies are required to use this plugin:
* **`lambda:InvokeFunction`**

## Lambda Custom Code Execution

The **AWS / Lambda / Custom Code Execution** plugin creates, executes, and optionally deletes a new Lambda function with the custom-code provided in the Job step as its input:

![Lambda Custom Code](/assets/img/aws-custom-lambda-code.png)<br>

In the example above, a new Lambda is created and is executed as a Python-3.9 script.  Any content defined in the **`return`** statement will be displayed in the log-output:

:::tip Note
Content within **`print`** statements will **not** be displayed in the log-output of the plugin. Any content you wish to see in Runbook Automation should be in the **`return`** statement.

#### Plugin Field Descriptions

* **Execution Role ARN**: This is the Lambda function's IAM role that grants the function permission to access AWS services and resources. More details on this can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html).
* **Lambda Runtime**: The runtime to use for the Lambda function. Only _interpreted_ languages are included here - not compiled languages.
* **Function Code**: This is the code to be executed by the Lambda function.  This must include a _handler_ which is identified in the `Name of Main Function` field.  More details on the handler can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-handler.html).
  ::: tip Supported Languages
    All _interpreted_ languages supported by AWS Lambda (Python, Ruby, Node.js) are usable within the plugin. Because the Lambda function is generated programmatically, _compiled_ languages such as Java and Go are not available within the plugin.
    :::
* **Name of Main Function**: The name of your _handler_ function.  In the example above, **`lambda_handler`** is the name of the main function.
* **Delete Function After Execution**: Select whether the Lambda that is created by this Job step should be automatically deleted after execution. The function will be deleted regardless of whether the execution of the Lambda code is successful. This is to avoid "orphaned" functions in your AWS environment.
* **Function AWS Description (Optional)**: Provide a description for the Lambda function. Because the plugin auto-generates the function's _Name_, this can be useful when you do _not_ auto-delete the function.
* **Event Payload (Optional)**: This is the event payload that you may pass to the function. It is optional, because you can use **Data Variables** to pass variables from other Job steps or Job Options into the script. For more detail on Data Variables, see [here](/learning/howto/passing-variables.html).
* **AWS Tags (Optional)**: Add tags to the Lambda that is created. This is useful when searching for Lambda Functions generated by Runbook Automation.

#### Context-Variables Output
Outputs from this plugin are automatically stored as context variables, and can therefore be used in subsequent steps:

**`data.invokeResponsePayloadString`**: Returns the raw response payload from the function invocation. If the function returns a JSON object, then the capture variable can be parsed as JSON.

![Data-Capture Variable Output](/assets/img/aws-lambda-capture-variable-output.png)

**`data.functionName`**: Returns the actual name of the function (generated by Rundeck), so the user can reference it later. The format is `rundeck-generated-function-<timestamp>`.

**`data.functionWasCreated`**: Returns "true" or "false" based on whether or not the function was successfully created

**`data.functionWasInvoked`**: Returns "true" or "false" based on whether or not the function was successfully invoked

**`data.functionWasDeleted`**: Returns "true" or "false" based on whether or not the function was successfully deleted

**`data.invokeFunctionError`**: Returns the function error value from the function invocation. Is valued "Handled" or "Unhandled" based on if the function handled its own error. Will be`null` if there was no error.

**`data.invokeExecutionLog`**: Returns the last 4KB of the CloudWatch logs from the functionâ€™s execution.

#### Permissions
The following IAM Policies are required to use this plugin:
* **`lambda:CreateFunction`**
* **`lambda:InvokeFunction`**
* **`lambda:DeleteFunction`** - Only if **`Delete Function After Execution`** is selected.
