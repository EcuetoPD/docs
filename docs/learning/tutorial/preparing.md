# 0 - Getting Started - Tutorial Preparations

This *Tutorial* section is built around our Welcome Projects. The Welcome Projects walk users through different Rundeck features and functionality without needing to download Rundeck locally on a server. These projects contain starter content that the following steps are built on top of.

Both Rundeck product versions, Enterprise or Community, have a companion set of code at the following links. These code bases allow running Rundeck in a Docker environment with the Welcome Project preloaded.

- Enterprise: [https://github.com/rundeckpro/welcome-project](https://github.com/rundeckpro/welcome-project)
- Community: [https://github.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community](https://github.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community)

Follow the readme steps for more information about getting the environments started.

:::tip
Note: The Enterprise version will require a license file. If you aren’t currently an Enterprise customer and you’re interested in using that please [contact us here](https://www.rundeck.com/see-demo).

:::warning
It is possible to run the Welcome Projects in other environments, but some exercise steps will need to be adjusted for your specific environment
