# Tutorials

With Rundeck, it is simple and easy to create automation workflows from any of
your existing tools or scripts. This Tutorial is written to help you quickly
become productive with the Rundeck server and tools.
Instructions are provided for both Enterprise and Community versions of Rundeck.

In each tutorial we highlight the full potential of Rundeck by showing how to
accomplish the task using our Enterprise version and where applicable we also
include steps for the Open Source version as well.

The tutorials are built around our Welcome Projects.  These projects contain
starter content that the following tutorials are build on top of.  

Both paths (Enterprise or Community) have a companion set of code at the following links.

- Enterprise: [https://github.com/rundeckpro/welcome-project](https://github.com/rundeckpro/welcome-project)
- Community: [https://github.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community](https://github.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community)

Follow the readme steps for more information about getting the environments started.

::: Note: The Enterprise version will require a license file. If you aren’t currently an Enterprise customer and you’re interested in using that please [contact us here](https://www.rundeck.com/see-demo).
