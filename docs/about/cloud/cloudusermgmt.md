# Rundeck Cloud - User Management


## Getting access
RDC is built and managed through the Pagerduty Platform and infrastructure. However the Rundeck Cloud product is not dependent on the Pagerduty product. Rundeck Cloud can be purchased alone without having a PD account. To request access to the Early Access program please email us at rundeck-ea@pagerduty.com.

## User roles
In Rundeck Cloud the Opsadmin and FullAdmin roles are not available to the user account. The highest privileged user role is the AppAdmin which allows full access to manage content (like projects, jobs, node sources etc) but cannot change any infrastructure configuration for the customer account instance. More details about the different roles coming soon.

## Does Rundeck Cloud support role based access and what roles are available?
Yes, role based access is supported and Run-only and AppAdmin roles are available.

## Do I need a separate login for Rundeck Cloud?
Currently PD and Rundeck Cloud accounts are separate. However,Single Sign On (Okta or Azure AD) for both products resulting in unified login experience. More details about the SSO config coming soon.
