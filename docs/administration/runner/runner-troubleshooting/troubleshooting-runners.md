# Troubleshooting Runners

## Runner Logs

Runner Logs are located in the `./runner/logs` folder under the folder where the jar was executed from.  The `runner.log` file contains operational and important messages about the runner.  `operations.log` tracks an operation starts and if it succeeds or fails.  [Read more about logging and setting up custom logging](/administration/runner/runner-management/runner-logging.md).
