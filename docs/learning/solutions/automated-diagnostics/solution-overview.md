# Automated Diagnostics

## What is PagerDuty's Automated Diagnostics Solution and what does it do for you?
Automated diagnostics can be of huge value when managing incidents. By pulling “diagnostic” data into your incidents, you can shorten the length of incidents, simplify results for the first responder and reduce the number of individuals paged to help with resolution.  Once you have implemented and configured the Diagnostic Solution, your responders can respond or draw in the right resources more quickly based on up-to-date diagnostics that they can understand. 
See [this blog post](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/democratize-capabilities-automation-actions) to learn more about the value of automated diagnostics.

PagerDuty provides a solution that helps users start automating diagnostics quickly. This Solution consists of **prebuilt Automation Jobs** that retrieve data from common infrastructure and services for investigating, debugging and diagnosing incidents:

As an example, if an incident is triggered for a service running in Kubernetes, PagerDuty Runbook Automation can retrieve information from logs, API’s, databases and other sources that support this service.  This could be triggered with the click of a button or through event-driven invocation.<br>
This information is then available in multiple interfaces such as PagerDuty's Mobil App, Slack, and Microsoft Teams:
