# Learning Rundeck

With Rundeck, it is simple and easy to create automation workflows from existing tools or scripts. The Learning section includes a Getting Started Tutorial and How to Guides that  help new users quickly become productive with the Rundeck server and tools. Instructions are provided for both Enterprise and Community versions of Rundeck.

Visit the [Tutorials](/learning/tutorial/preparing) to see practical step-by-step guides that help you get your Rundeck account up and running - starting with installing and configuring Rundeck. Use the [How To](/learning/howto/overview) section accomplish the task using the Rundeck Enterprise version and where applicable, the steps for the Community version.

The *How To* articles go deeper into specific topics and are also commonly built around the Welcome Project plus completion of the base tutorial.

Both Rundeck product versions, Enterprise or Community, have a companion set of code at the following links. These code bases allow running Rundeck in a Docker environment with the Welcome Project preloaded.

- Community: [https://github.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community](https://github.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community)
