- H2 is updated to version 2.x to address a Critical vulnerability.

:::danger
Warning: The old version of the H2 database is not compatible with the newer version. There is no mechanism to migrate a database in the new version automatically without including the old, vulnerable libraries. The process must be done manually following the details on the [Upgrading to 4.1](/upgrading/upgrading-to-4.1.md) page.

## Commercial Versions

### New Plugins

We continue to add plugins to help automate cloud operations. New plugins include:

- [Job Steps to pull AWS CloudWatch](/manual/workflow-steps/aws-cloudwatch.md) logs into Job Output. These new plugins retrieve diagnostic data from AWS infrastructure and applications making it easier to run automated diagnostics for AWS across multiple accounts and products.
- [AWS EC2 Node Health Check](/manual/healthcheckplugins/aws-ec2-healthcheck.md)
- [GCP Compute Node Health Check](/manual/healthcheckplugins/gcp-compute-healthcheck.md)
- Ability to set custom DataDog API URLs for customers outside the U.S.
- Private IP address is now visible on nodes from [Azure Node Source](/manual/projects/resource-model-sources/azure.md).
