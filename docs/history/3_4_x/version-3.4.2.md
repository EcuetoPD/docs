## Overview
Check out the new features and enhancements for Rundeck Enterprise and Rundeck Community included in this release.

### Job Data [Incubating] (Enterprise)

The Job Data feature brings "Output data that is easy to digest" to Rundeck.

Log Output can be long, complicated, and often lacks focus. Use this to output key log data in an easily consumable and consistent format.  The job data output is available through itâ€™s own API endpoint from the Job Activity.  The initial release builds JSON output either from a user defined template or from global variable namespaces.

Use cases for this feature cover a broad range of ideas.  Jobs can now be thought of as composable functions that return data

[Check out the documentation for how to enable the incubating feature.](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/manual/execution-lifecycle/job-data.html)

### Ruleset Visualization [Incubating] (Enterprise)

Rulesets can be complicated to write. The Ruleset visualization offers a view of how the Workflow will progress based on the rules written.  This feature is enabled by default on 3.4.2.

### Azure Node Steps (Enterprise)

In 3.4.1, new node steps were introduced to add more functionality to the already existing Azure Resource Model. Now you can control your imported nodes in Rundeck by using the following new job steps:

* Start a Virtual Machine
* Stop a Virtual Machine
* Restart a Virtual Machine
* Delete a Virtual Machine
* Capture Snapshot of Machine Instances

### ServiceNow Node Source Custom Filters (Enterprise)

In 3.4.1, we added the ability to specify custom filters when setting up the ServiceNow Node Source. Now, you can add any filters you may use in ServiceNow to ensure that only the nodes you want are imported into Rundeck.
