# Learning Rundeck

With Rundeck, it is simple and easy to create automation workflows from existing tools or scripts.
This Tutorial is written to help new Rundecker users quickly become productive with the Rundeck server and tools.
Instructions are provided for both Enterprise and Community versions of Rundeck.

In each step of the tutorial we highlight the full potential of Rundeck by showing how to
accomplish the task using our Enterprise version and where applicable we also
include steps for the Community version as well.

The *Tutorial* section is built around our Welcome Projects. These projects contain starter content that the following tutorials are build on top of.

The *How To* articles go deeper into specific topics and are also commonly built around the Welcome Project plus completion of the base tutorial.

Both Rundeck product versions, Enterprise or Community, have a companion set of code at the following links.  These code bases allow running Rundeck in a Docker environment with the Welcome Project preloaded.

- Enterprise: [https://github.com/rundeckpro/welcome-project](https://github.com/rundeckpro/welcome-project)
- Community: [https://github.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community](https://github.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community)

Follow the readme steps for more information about getting the environments started.

The first step is to learn some key Rundeck Terms in our [Terminology Tutorial](terminology.md).

:::tip
Note: The Enterprise version will require a license file. If you aren’t currently an Enterprise customer and you’re interested in using that please [contact us here](https://www.rundeck.com/see-demo).

:::warning
It is possible to run the Welcome Projects in other environments, but some exercise steps will need to be adjusted for your specific environment
