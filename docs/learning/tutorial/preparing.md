# 0. Getting Started - Tutorial Preparations

The _Tutorial_ section is built around our Welcome Projects. The Rundeck Welcome Projects are sample projects that show how to configure and use Rundeck.

Both Rundeck product versions, Enterprise or Community, have a companion set of code at the following links. These code bases allow running Rundeck in a Docker environment with the Welcome Project preloaded.


- Enterprise: [https://github.com/rundeckpro/welcome-project](https://github.com/rundeckpro/welcome-project)
- Community: [https://github.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community](https://github.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community)

Follow the readme steps for more information about getting the environments started.

The first step is to learn some key Rundeck Terms in our [Terminology Tutorial](/learning/tutorial/terminology.md).
