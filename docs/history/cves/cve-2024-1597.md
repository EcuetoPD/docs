# CVE-2024-1597

## Postgres JDBC Driver Vulnerability


This issue is patched in versions [`4.17.5`](/history/version-4.17.5.md) and [`5.1.1`](/hostory/verison-5.1.1.md).  After patching the server version ensure that any Enterprise Runner instance are also updated to the latest version.

If patching to one of these versions is not possible immediately* customers should check for the use of `PreferQueryMode=SIMPLE` in two key areas:

- If Postgres is used as the database backend for Rundeck/Process Automation On Prem confirm that the database connection strings are not leveraging that setting.
- Check any jobs using the `SQL Run Step` plugin to ensure the string above is not used.

::: warning *Upgrade Recommended 
It is still highly recommended to update the server and Enterprise Runners to the patched versions if using Postgres.
