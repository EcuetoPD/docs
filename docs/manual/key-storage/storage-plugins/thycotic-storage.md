### Setting Descriptions

- **Type**
: This specifies the storage plugin to use. For Thycotic, the value should always be `thycotic-storage`.

- **Path**
: The path in Rundeck storage tree to apply the plugin. If just `keys` is specified, then all keys and directories added to Rundeck Key Storage will also be added to Thycotic.

- **removePathPrefix**
: By default, the storage plugin will be invoked using the full path that is requested. If set to true, the path used when invoking the storage plugin would not include the prefix. It is recommended to set it to true. If set to false, keys will not be displayed unless a directory is specified in Rundeck.

- **Username**
: Username for an account with access to the secrets that will be used in Rundeck.

- **Password**
: The password for a user in the account where the secrets should be stored.

- **Address**
: The base URL for the secret server account where the secrets should be saved. For example, `https://example.secretservercloud.com`.
: If using Thycotic on-premises, the address must be appended with `/SecretServer`, so your full URL will be `https://example.yourdomain.com/SecretServer`.

- **allowSelfSignedCert**
: Set to true if wishing to use self-signed certificates to access the Thycotic server.

- **maximumResources**
: Default value: 100 . This value allows the user to customize the number of resources to retrieve from thycotic.
