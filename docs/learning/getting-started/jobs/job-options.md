# Job Options
Rundeck Jobs can be configured to prompt the user for input at the time a Job is run. These inputs are called _options_, which simulate a named parameter (required or optional) and are available to the user when the Job is executed. Rundeck Job Options are similar to variables, a space to put a value that will influence how the Job will run. For example, a Job Option might represent whether or not a script will run in a verbose mode or not. Effectively, job options allow a job runner to customize the job in some ways at runtime without having access to change the actual job.<br>
Rundeck, PagerDuty Process Automation and Runbook Automation have two kinds of options: _text_ and _file_.<br>
## Option Type: Text
![](~@assets/img/joboptions1.png)<br>
The form for defining text options includes the following areas:<br>
### Identification
Option Name and Description are entered here. The Description will be made available to people executing the Job as help text.<br>
### Input Type
"Plain," "Date," "Secure," and "Secure Remote Authentication" are available types. Multi-valued options are only available for input type "Plain".<br>
* Plain Text 
The most common type of option in Jobs, Plain Text stores a string to use in any part of the workflow.<br>
* Date 
Date options allows you to define dates as an option. Date options uses the _moment js_ format, and the full reference of this format is available [here](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/).<br>
* Secure Option 
A safe option where the value is hidden when the user enters it. For Secure Options, the GUI displays a password prompt rather than a standard text field or drop-down menu. Unlike other option values, the Secure Option values are not stored with the execution.<br>
* Remote Secure Option
A safe choice that is hidden from scripts and commands and only used for remote authentication. The node executor and node definition must directly support this type of option.<br>
Passwords for SSH and/or sudo authentication mechanisms can be used with the built-in SSH Provider for node execution. Those passwords are provided via Secure Remote Authentication Options defined in a Job.<br>
### Date Format
If Date Input Type is selected, users provide a date format to be used when selecting the date in the user interface (see "Date" in the next section).<br>
### Default Value
If the option is not otherwise supplied by the user, it will automatically be set to the default value.  This applies to cases when an option hasnâ€™t been specified among the arguments and the task is executed using the command-line or an API. The use of the Default Value will be overridden if a blank value is given via the command-line or API.<br>
### Allowed values
This can contain a static list of values or a URL to a server providing option data. Values can be specified as a comma separated list as seen above but can also be requested from an external source using a "remote URL".<br>
An external source known as a [remote option provider](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/manual/job-options.html#option-model-provider) can be used to obtain a list of permitted option values. Permitted values are retrieved from the specified URL when the valuesUrl parameter for an Option is specified.<br>
### Restrictions
This defines criteria on which inputs to allow. If "Enforced from values" is set to "true", Rundeck will only present a popup menu containing allowed options. If set to "false", a text field will also be presented to enter other values. Enter a regular expression in the "Match Regular Expression" field to be evaluated when the Job is run.<br>
### Requirement
Specifies whether Job must have a non-blank value for this Option in order to be executed. Choose "No" to say that a blank value is acceptable and "Yes" to say that a blank value is not acceptable. If a Default Value is set, then it will be used when no value is provided, unless a blank value is allowed and is explicitly specified.<br>
### Should be hidden
If set to true, the option will be hidden when running the job. This is useful when the objective is to pass a static option to a script/command step, avoiding any user change.<br>
### Multi-valued
Defines if input can consist of multiple values. Choosing "No" states that only a single value can be chosen as input. Choosing "Yes" states that the user may select multiple input values from the Allowed values and/or enter multiple values of their own.<br>
### Delimiter
The delimiter string that will be used to separate multiple values when the Job is run.<br>
### Select All Values by Default
If checked, and no default value(s) are specified, all of the remote or local values will be selected by default.<br>
## Option Type: File
![](~@assets/img/jobotions2.png)<br>
The option type file permits uploading a file that can be utilized as part of the Job. Areas displayed when setting up a File Option Type are a subset of those available in the Text Option Type.<br>
## How to reference options on command steps and script steps
### Command Step
To reference a Job Option from a Command Step use the following notation:<br>
`${option.myoption}`<br>
Example:` echo "the result is: ${option.myoption}"`<br>
### Inline Script step
On Inline scripts the right format is<br>
`@option.myoption@`<br>
Example:` echo "the result is: @option.myoption@"`<br>
### Script step
If you're using a script stored in the server file system and you want to use a Rundeck Option, the format is<br>
`$RD_OPTION_MYOPTION`<br>
Example:` echo "the result is: $RD_OPTION_MYOPTION"`<br>
