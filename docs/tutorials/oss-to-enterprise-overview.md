# Migrating from OSS to Enterprise

Congratulations on your decision to upgrade to Rundeck Enterpise! You are on track to automating your workflows and reducing incident time. There are two options moving forward:
* You could set up Rundeck Enterprise on the same server that the open source version is set up on. This is the fastest way to migrate. To use this method, follow the instructions [here](oss-to-enterprise-migration-same.md).

* You could set up Rundeck Enterprise on a new server. This is an option to consider when you want to change the project structure, or if you want to ensure that Rundeck Enterprise is set up before you remove Rundeck open source. To use this method, follow the instructions [here](oss-to-enterprise-migration-new.md).
