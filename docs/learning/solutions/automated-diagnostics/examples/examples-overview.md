# Automated Diagnostics
---

## Examples & Best Practices

The following sections outline common diagnostics for different types of infrastructure and applications.  
Details are also provided on the various mechanisms that can be used to integrate with the various environments.  
For example, with many technologies, there are options to integrate using plugins, command-line interfaces (CLI’s), or “raw” API calls.

In addition, many sections include example Jobs that can be imported into your Automation Instance - helping you get started quickly with Automated Diagnostics.  
Other prebuilt Jobs are included in the Automated Diagnostics Solution package, which is preinstalled for Runbook Automation customers and can be downloaded for Process Automation customers from the [getting started](/learning/solutions/automated-diagnostics/getting-started) section.
