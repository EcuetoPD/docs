# Automated Diagnostics
## Getting Started

::: tip Prerequisites
To use the Automated Diagnostics Solution, you must either have a **PagerDuty Runbook Automation** license or a **Process Automation** license.
See the [FAQ](/learning/solutions/automated-diagnostics/feedback-faq) for details on how to use with **Rundeck Community**.
If you do not have a license for either of these products, [contact us](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-us/runbook-automation/) to learn more.

**You must be running at least version 4.8.0 to use this Solution.** New instances of Runbook Automation have the Solution installed and included by default.<br>
