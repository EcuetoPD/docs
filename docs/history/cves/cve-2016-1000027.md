# CVE-2016-1000027

## Unsafe Java deserialization methods in Spring Security

The problem outlined in CVE-2016-1000027 entails the utilization of specific classes within the Spring library, which are not utilized by Rundeck/Runbook Automation. Consequently, the solution is immune to the issues associated with that library.

Presently, there isn't a remedy available within the current Spring 5.x framework. However, upon transitioning to the subsequent version of Grails, we anticipate leveraging Spring 6 to resolve the concerns flagged by scanners.
